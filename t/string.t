# Before `make install' is performed this script should be runnable with
# `make test'. After `make install' it should work as `perl test.pl'

######################### We start with some black magic to print on failure.

# Change 1..1 below to 1..last_test_to_print .
# (It may become useful if the test is moved to ./t subdirectory.)

use Test;
BEGIN { $| = 1; plan tests => 5, onfail => sub { $? = 1 if $ENV{AEGIS_TEST} } }
END {print "not ok 1\n" unless $loaded;}
use Test::Cmd;
$loaded = 1;
ok(1);

######################### End of black magic.

# Insert your test code below (better if it prints "ok 13"
# (correspondingly "not ok 13") depending on the success of chunk 13
# of the test code):

my($test);

$test = Test::Cmd->new;
ok($test);
ok(! $test->string);

$test->string('foo');
ok($test->string eq 'foo');
