Revision history for Perl extension Test::Cmd.

1.03	Sat Jun  9 16:57:16 CDT 2001

	- Make specification of an 'interpreter' to the run() method
	  independent of whether a 'prog' has been specified.

	- Actually store the absolute path to a workdir specified as a
	  relative path, as advertised.
	  (Thanks to Jonathan Ross <Jonathan.C.Ross@fmr.com> for
	  finding this bug and contributing a patch.)



1.02

	- Small fix to make match() backwards compatible to Perl 5.003.

	- Add diff_exact() and diff_regex() methods for returning
	  UNIX diff(1)-like output from file comparisons.

	- Accomodate $TMPDIR specifications that vary from Cwd::cwd()
	  due to symbolic links or omission of NT drive letters.



1.01  Sun Aug 27 05:40:35 CDT 2000

	- Add a match_exact() method for non-regex matches.

	- Change the name of the match() method to match_regex().

	- Add a new match() method that calls a registered
	  line-matching subroutine to do the match.  By default,
	  this is match_regex(), so the external interface stays
	  backwards-compatible.

	- Add a match_sub() method that allows an arbitrary
	  line-matching subroutine to be registered.

	- EXPORT_OK the match_exact() and match_regex() methods
	  to make it easier to register them.



1.00

	- The early versions have been out there long enough,
	  so promote the version number to 1.00.



0.05

	- White space cleanup.

	- Small fixes for Perl 5.003:  put quotes around hash index
	  strings; don't use "my" on the same line as "foreach".

	- Add copyright statements to appropriate files.



0.04  Tue Feb  1 05:20:19 CST 2000

	- Removed unnecessary t0001a.pl file (internal testing glue
	  for the change management system).

	- In the run() method, add the ability to pipe input into a
	  command.

	- Add a match() method that matches input lines one-for-one
	  against an equal number of of regular expressions.

	- Have the run() method support 'prog' and 'interpreter' arguments,
	  for one-shot execution of a program.

	- Remove direct exception throws (calls to $self->no_result)
	  by the run() and workdir() methods.  Exceptions should be
	  handled by the test itself or a subclass specific to the
	  program under test.



0.03  Wed Jan 12 18:02:38 CST 2000

	- Minor white space cleanup.

	- Allow the write() method to take an absolute path name.

	- Documentation cleanup.

	- Add a read() method as a companion to write().

	- Directories were still removed on fail/no result if
	  PRESERVE_FAIL and PRESERVE_NO_RESULT were set.  Fixed.

	- Where possible, use array assignment, not shift, for
	  method arguments.



0.02  Mon Jan  3 23:59:53 2000

	- Add a string() method to arrange for printing info about
	  specific functionality under test upon failure or no result.

	- Add a basename() method to return the basename of the
	  program under test (the prog() method returns the full path).

	- Add a workpath() method to catfile its arguments to the
	  end of the temporary working directory; this pushes more
	  of the OS-dependent gunk into the module.

	- Allow the write() method to take an array reference as a
	  file name argument, in which case the arguments are
	  concatenated using File::Spec->catfile().

	- Allow the subdir() method to take a array references as
	  arguments, in which case the elements are concatenated
	  using File::Spec->catfile().

	- Change the run() method to take named-keyword arguments
	  like $test->run(args => '1 2 3', chdir => 'sub/dir')
	  instead of the old positional arguments.

	- Add $caller arguments to the fail() and no_result()
	  methods which specify how many levels back to print a
	  trace of the exiting line.  This allows nested packages
	  to get back to the original caller.



0.01  Thu Nov 11 15:50:32 1999

	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
