Revision history for Perl extension Test::Cmd.

0.02  Mon Jan  3 23:59:53 2000

	- Add a string() method to arrange for printing info about
	  specific functionality under test upon failure or no result.

	- Add a basename() method to return the basename of the
	  program under test (the prog() method returns the full path).

	- Add a workpath() method to catfile its arguments to the
	  end of the temporary working directory; this pushes more
	  of the OS-dependent gunk into the module.

	- Allow the write() method to take an array reference as a
	  file name argument, in which case the arguments are
	  concatenated using File::Spec->catfile().

	- Allow the subdir() method to take a array references as
	  arguments, in which case the elements are concatenated
	  using File::Spec->catfile().

	- Change the run() method to take named-keyword arguments
	  like $test->run(args => '1 2 3', chdir => 'sub/dir')
	  instead of the old positional arguments.

	- Add $caller arguments to the fail() and no_result()
	  methods which specify how many levels back to print a
	  trace of the exiting line.  This allows nested packages
	  to get back to the original caller.
